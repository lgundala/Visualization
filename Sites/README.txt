Assignment 4
I was able to do pretty much everything except for synchronizing.
****** mistake in the shown data: somehow the x axis of graph do not align as the comparable histogram . ex: at 1999 and 2000. there is a diff in the values. Wasn’t able to fix it by the time.
Update: pretty much no errors with loading the data.

Changing the size of bar shows the zoomed graph and pan as well.

my dataset is stackable.csv

I used a line graph and bar chart for this assignment

Here are some of the pages I got help from

Before today’s class, I wasn’t able to get the grid lines properly aligned with axis. The problem was the the grid had common function for both svgs. But the axis limits varied with their respective datasets. So, When I made sure the limits were according to their common dataset, I was able to get proper comparable diagrams.
Update: I removed the grid from graph. Just so in case, I have included the first submission dual_first.htm
Final submission dual.htm

I tried to get the pan and zoom working. But, couldn’t get the synchronize working.
